		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello, my name is Sarah Joi Ballesteros Pagkaliwagan, but you can call me sjaye or ate sjaye<sup>1</sup>. I'm now in my second to third year of college, struggling but still alive<sup>2</sup>. Anyway, let me tell you about my life, beginning with my childhood<sup>3</sup>. I was born last, and being the youngest makes me the favorite while also making me the target of bullying from my siblings<sup>4</sup>. But I think it's normal; when I started kindergarten at the same school where my siblings graduated, the teachers were like "there goes another pagkaliwagan, and what kind of hardheaded person is this?" but I beg to differ with them because I'm different from my siblings because of the age difference between my brothers and sisters<sup>5</sup>.They saw me as the improved version, smarter, happier, and braver than my siblings, and I became an honor student<sup>6</sup>. My mother enrolled me in a ballet class when I was in first grade, but I only stayed for a year because I wasn't as graceful as the other girls in the class<sup>7</sup>. I joined the arts club in second grade and enjoyed it so much that I entered some arts competitions and won several, but then I got bored and quit when I entered third grade. I joined the softball club in third grade because I was inspired by my uncles on my father's side who played for the Philippine team, and I learned teamwork and how to be a leader during those years<sup>8</sup>.Even at a young age, he was a leader in a room full of older people<sup>9</sup>. I stayed there until fourth grade, when I quit basketball and volleyball because I was bored<sup>10</sup>. Then a friend introduced me to taekwondo, and because I like action movies with martial arts, I joined right away<sup>11</sup>. It was fun, and I felt the fulfillment I had been looking for<sup>12</sup>. I even tried to compete in milo summer competition, palarong maynila, and palarong pambansa<sup>13</sup>. In my taekwondo journey, I met new people and witnessed events that I had only seen in movies, such as a "bloody competition" in which my lips burst from a kick and I received a black eye<sup>14</sup>.When my opponent punched me (it was a foul and I got the points), when I lost a tooth from a kick, and especially when I sprained my elbow and ankle from various stunts we do<sup>15</sup>. But, at the end of the day, I had fun, and that's what matters, right?.By the sixth grade, I had the opportunity to join the journalism club. I was hired as the club's graphic artist, and because they knew I was competitive, they forced me to compete in a competition under the club's name<sup>16</sup>. In that competition, I received several awards for my work as a graphic artist<sup>16</sup>. I tried to end grade school on a high note by presenting the school with several awards from my journalism and tekwondo clubs<sup>17</sup>. I graduated with honors and a few school-specific awards<sup>18</sup>. After graduation, I made one last attempt to compete in taekwondo at Milo Summer Camp, where I won my fifth gold medal<sup>19</sup>.And summer came me and my uncles and aunties went to baguio for the first time<sup>20</sup>.

		<p><blockquote>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In high school, I started from scratch because I started my grade school in a public school and had the opportunity to enroll in a private school in high school<sup>1</sup>. I don't know anyone or anything about the location; all I see are people catching up with friends from elementary school or previous years<sup>2</sup>.
		I felt so lost and depressed because I didn't have any friends or people I knew, and the only thing I had in me were the memories I had with my friends<sup>3</sup>. Weeks had passed and before I knew it, I had met so many wonderful people who shared my interests, particularly those who enjoyed music<sup>4</sup>. I realized there that I really want to learn musical instruments such as guitar, and my circle of friends grew from there<sup>5</sup>.In addition, I began to form friendships with some of them, who are still my friends today<sup>5</sup>. Before I knew it, my first year of high school was coming to an end, and I found out that I received the full scholarship that I applied for when I first started at the school<sup>6</sup>. The second year of high school was when I realized I was bisexual and why I was more attracted to girls than to guys<sup>7</sup>. Don't get me wrong, I still like guys; it's just that I have high standards for them<sup>8</sup>. But when it comes to girls, as long as this person is genuine and real, I'll be head over heels for her<sup>9</sup>I've had a lot of crushes and flirtations, but I've never been in a serious relationship<sup>10</sup>. I had my heart broken several times before realizing that my second year was coming to an end and all I could think about was how I would approach my crush<sup>11</sup>. I guess I'm too preoccupied with myself rather than my studies, and I'm losing my focus and mind while studying<sup>12</sup>.My teachers told me in my third grade in my second year of high school that if I don't get serious about studying, I'll lose and my parents will be disappointed in me, so I tried to focus and study from night to morning that I didn't even get the chance to pick up my guitar<sup>13</sup>. By that point, I had nearly perfect scores on all of my quizzes and activities, as well as on the major exam<sup>14</sup>. I got back on track, but I also started losing friends<sup>15</sup>.On my third year of high school, I met these wonderful people who became my bestfriends, and we call our group Mirutenshi<sup>16</sup>. its a japanse word translates in english as friends of angels<sup>17</sup>. They never let me get off track when it comes to studying, and they never abandoned me when I needed help from my subjects<sup>18</sup>. This year is also my year for learning new things, and thanks to my friends, I've had the opportunity to learn violin, keyboard piano, bass guitar, and my personal favorite, drums<sup>19</sup>.never have i ever thought that i will be formning my band with them, meeting them was the best thing happen until now<sup>20</sup>.

		<p><blockquote>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In my college years, I began as a psychology major at the same school where I graduated high school<sup>1</sup>. At first, I was having fun, but when my heart was broken, I didn't know what to do<sup>2</sup>. I was too depressed to even go to school, let alone leave the house, and that was the time I dropped everything in my college life and went to work<sup>3</sup>.But then my parents talked to me, and I told them, ok, I'll try again this time, and it was good but not good enough, and I told them I want to change my program and be a teacher, and I tried to shift but the school wouldn't let me because of my previews action<sup>4</sup>. and I told my parents I wanted to try at UE, and when I transferred here, the college dean even helped me write a letter explaining why I wanted to be a part of the college of education<sup>5</sup>.I began as a free section student and have transferred to various college departments due to the subjects that are only available to that college department<sup>6</sup>. I met many people and even had the opportunity to be a part of an organization called the UE artist alliance, which is a group of artists ranging from graphic designers to writers<sup>7</sup>.However, not everything is the same as it was in my elementary and high school years<sup>8</sup>. I was so excited to try everything that I lost my focus and missed out on the opportunity to focus on my studies<sup>9</sup>. I tried everything from drinking to smoking to skipping classes, and I even tried not to go to school at all<sup>10</sup>.but everything change when I needed to bring my parents to school because of my dropped subject , I dont know why im doing it I thing because of just a peer pressure or because its my way of telling them that im burned out and I want to just rest and that is what I did I stopped for 1 year after that and I worked as a tutor in a center for a few months after that I also work at a BPO company but it only lasted 2 months and I quit because of the toxic environment<sup>11</sup>.My journey did not end there because when I returned to my studies, I met new faces and new people, but the worst part was that I needed to get an overload for my curriculum, which caused me to burn out quickly<sup>12</sup>. I also received a memo from the dead stating that I needed to get 2.75 in order to continue on to my third year, but I assumed it would be simple and that I would just need to show up on time and pass the necessary requirements, but it is more difficult than I anticipated<sup>13</sup>. A strict professor just crushed my dream of becoming a teacher by humiliating me in front of the class<sup>14</sup>. I know it's part of the job and it was a test, but the fact that the lesson plan did is like trash to her<sup>15</sup>. I finished the 100 lesson plan she requested, even if it was only for two days without sleep, and she just threw it in the trash can like it belonged there<sup>15</sup>. and my educational journey came to an end<sup>16</sup>. I stopped smoking for another two years and worked in a vape shop for a year and a half, and my boss told me before I quit that he wants me to graduate and be a successful person<sup>17</sup>. I did what he said, but now I'm at a loss for what to do because my education career ended without me even starting it<sup>18</sup>. My brother talked to me and told me that if I take an IT course, he will support my studies, which I did, and I passed every subject in my first year<sup>19</sup>. I started from scratch because I am not a techie or know anything about IT. I tried to research but because I don't have anything I can use, I only use my phone<sup>20</sup>.
